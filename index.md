# Project Name/Title Goes Here
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My starter project was the TV-B gone project. It was built by soldering all the parts together. I attached the corresponding parts to their spot on the board and soldered them to the board. After, I soldered the wire from the battery pack to the board. Pressing the on button will start the kit to emit IR codes which tells the chip to reset and emit all the code in the library. Since the LED lights have the have the most common IR used in remotes, they can replicate the IR signal to turn off the TV. The IR codes are sent through the LED by starting quickly pulsed and then pulsing slower, this is because some Tvs will only listen to certain frequencies of the IR codes sent.
