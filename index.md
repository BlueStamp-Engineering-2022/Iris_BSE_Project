# 3 Joint Robot Arm
 This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is the bluetooth control of the robot arm. I wired the bluetooth module to the arduino and used MIT app inventor to make an app to control the robot. When you press the controls on the app, it sends a bluetooth signal to the output stream which will get picked up by the bluetooth module connected to the arduino. At first, I struggled with getting the arm to move because even when the serial monitor showed that it was receiving input from the app, the arm wouldn’t move: I realized that this was because I was changing the position of the servo by such a small amount and I wasn't using a while loop. My final step will be to use CAD to add modifications to the robot claw.

# First Milestone
My first milestone is the intial build of the robot arm. It's a mechanical arm controlled using an arduino microcontroller. It uses 2 JoyStick modules to control the angle degree of 4 servos. I constructed the hardware of the arm, wired the arduino to the arm and wrote my own code to control the arm. I struggled with the reliability of the controls, because sometimes certain functions of the arm would stop working (usually wiring problems). My next step is to make the arm controlled by a phone rather than joysticks.

# Starter Project
  

My starter project was the TV-B gone project. It was built by soldering all the parts together. I attached the corresponding parts to their spot on the board and soldered them to the board. After, I soldered the wire from the battery pack to the board. Pressing the on button will start the kit to emit IR codes which tells the chip to reset and emit all the code in the library. Since the LED lights have the have the most common IR used in remotes, they can replicate the IR signal to turn off the TV. The IR codes are sent through the LED by starting quickly pulsed and then pulsing slower, this is because some Tvs will only listen to certain frequencies of the IR codes sent.
